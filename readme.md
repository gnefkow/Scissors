<h1>Requirements</h1>

* Only two users can play at the same time.

* Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

* The game will track each player's wins and losses.

* Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

* Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
