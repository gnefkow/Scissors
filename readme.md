<h1>Play the game</h1>
<p>This is a two player game, so grab a friend and <a href="https://gnefkow.github.io/Scissors/" target="_blank">send them this link to play!</a>. Note that, unfortunately, only two people can play at a time at this point, so if someone else is in the room, you can kick them out but that would be really mean, so use this power wisely!</p>

<br>
<br>

<h1>How to test this game</h1>
<p> Note that this is a two-player game, so to test, you need to simulate that there are two players.
<ul>
  <li>Open the game by clicking the link in TWO seperate tabs</li>
  <li>If someone else is currently playing the game, you will be locked out. You can force-end someone else's game by clicking the force lockout button</li>
  <li>Note that if you open the game in a third window, that window will automatically be locked out</li>
  <li>The first person that enters the game is "Ash," The second person that enters the game is "Gary." "Your" name is at the bottom of the screen, your opponent's name is at the top.</li>
  <li>Make your selection by tapping one of the buttons at the bottom. (Do this on both instances). Note that the opponent's selection is displayed after both players have made their selections.</li>
  <li>To see the winner, you have to look in the console log. Sorry, lol, This is the next update coming up!</li>
  <li>To play another round, one player must tap the reset button in the bottom right corner</li>
  <li>To exit the game, tap the button in the top left corner.</li>
<ul>


<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h3>Implemented:</h3>
* Only two users can play at the same time.

* Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

* Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

<h3>Not Implemented:</h3>
* The game will track each player's wins and losses.

* Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
